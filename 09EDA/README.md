Exploratory Data Analysis is a data analytics process to understand the data in depth and learn the different data characteristics, often with visual means. This allows you to get a better feel of your data and find useful patterns in it.

- Helps preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Allows a machine learning model to predict our dataset better.
- Gives more accurate results.
- It also helps us to choose a better machine learning model.

Steps Involved in Exploratory Data Analysis:

1. `Data Collection`
2. `Data Cleaning`
    - Removing missing values, outliers, and unnecessary rows/ columns.
    - Re-indexing and reformatting our data.
3. `Univariate Analysis`: In Univariate Analysis, you analyze data of just one variable. A variable in your dataset refers to a single feature/ column.
   - `Histograms`: Bar plots in which the frequency of data is represented with rectangle bars.
   - `Box-plots`: Here the information is represented in the form of boxes.
4. `Bivariate Analysis`: Use two variables and compare them. This way, you can find how one feature affects the other.
   - `Numeric-Numeric Analysis`: both the variables being compared have numeric data.s. To compare two numeric columns, you can use `scatter plots`, `pair plots`, and `correlation` matrices.
   - `Numeric - Categorical Analysis`: one variable is of numeric type and another is a categorical variable.You can use the `groupby` function to arrange the data into similar groups.
   - `Categorical â€” Categorical Analysis`: When both the variables contain categorical data, you perform categorical-categorical analysis
